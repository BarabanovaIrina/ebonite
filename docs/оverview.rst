Overview
============

Ebonite is a framework to manage ML modelsâ€™ lifecycle.
It is effective tool for their deployment and controlling reproducibility.
The main idea of Ebonite to create End-to-End Pipelines,
it is built for ML specialist and permits to focus precisely on data science.

With a view to production prediction it helps ML teams to build API services easily and quickly.
Ebonite is a library for Python and it supports any arbitrary Python function and most popular ML frameworks: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, XGBoost, LightGBM, PyTorch, CatBoost, etc. See more here `Ebonite Extensions`_

Challenges of real world
------------------------

- Integrate your models into existing infrastructure
- Wrap the model and run as a service
- Track Model Metrics and Need to follow degradation of models
- Provide fast delivery of models in production
- An easy way to test hypotheses

You need Ebonite if
-------------------
- Have more than 1 ML models
- Need to new models appear
- Need to Accelerates prototyping
- Need to re-train and update often
- Need to train multistaging models
- Have several team working on different models
